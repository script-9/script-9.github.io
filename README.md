## ROADMAP

- Document existing code
- On error, tell user where it happened
  - eventually we should be able to click to go to error
- If code forced a termination/init, let user know
- enable keyboard shortcuts to cycle between tabs
- add CODE 0-7
- remember what CODE number you were on when you went away from CODE


## DEPLOY

- npm run push-version
- npm run deploy

## GOALS

- 1. 100% lighthouse score
- 2. PWA
